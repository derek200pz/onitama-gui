#ONITAMA
This python GUI uses tkinter to display a graphical user interface for the game "Onitama".
The GUI can be used for two people to play against each other, or it can be used to have a player compete against a computer, or two computers compete.
The computer players will be separate programs that will communicate through editing text files to inform the GUI of their moves.
